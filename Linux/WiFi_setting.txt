====== WiFi setting ======
Created None

When I try to install a image from Ubuntu, I need to setup wifi networking. As server one can not use GUI for WiFi setting. The tool can be directly used is nmcli

1. check devices 
	''sudo nmcli dev''
2. activate WiFi
	''sudo nmcli r wifi on''
3. scan hot point 
	''sudo nmcli dev wifi''
4. connect WiFi 
	''sudo nmcli dev wifi connect "''**SSID**''" password "''**PASSWORD**''" ifname wlan0''
