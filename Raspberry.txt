====== Raspberry ======
Created None

===== Solve g++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus) =====
This problem is caused because raspberry ususally does not have large RAM for building, such as compiling Qt or OpenCV. Therefore we need to add a swap area for coding. 

1. create a swap area 8G
	dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1k count=8117000 
2. generate swap file system 
	sudo mkswap /swapfile
3. activate swap file 
	sudo chmod 0600 /swapfile
	sudo swapon /swapfile
4. setup auto activation
	in [[/etc/fstab]] file adding,
	 [[/swapfile]] swap swap defaults 0 0
