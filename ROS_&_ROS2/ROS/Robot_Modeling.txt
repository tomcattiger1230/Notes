====== Robot Modeling ======
Created 星期日 15 七月 2018

===== Summary =====
ROS has a standard meta package for designing, and creating robot models ''robot_model.model, ''which consists of a set of packages called'' urdf, kdl_parser, robot_state_publisher, collada_urdf'', and so on. 

===== Using URDF =====
URDF is unified robot description format. It follows the rule of XML. Some tags are introduced in the following sections, more can be refered in http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML. In URDF, one can only define the rigid links, and the flexible links can't be defined using URDF (so how?).

The URDF can represent the kinematic and dynamic description of the robot, visual representation of the robot, and the collision model of the robot.


==== URDF tags ====

=== link ===
The link tag represents a single link of a robot. Using this tag, we can model a robot link and its properties. The modeling includes **size**, **shape**, **color**, and can even i**mport a 3D mesh** to represent the robot link. We can also provide **dynamic properties** of the link such as **inertial matrix** and **collision properties**.

	<link name="<name of the link>">
	<inertial> ... </inertial>
	<visiual> ... </visual>
	<collision> ... </collision>
	</link>


=== joint ===
joint is bewteen two links. The joint tag represents a robot joint. We can specify the **kinematics** and **dynamics** of the joint and also set the **limits** of the joint movement and its velocity. The joint tag supports the different types of joints such as **revolute**, **continuous**, **prismatic**, **fixed**, **floating**, and **planar**.

	<joint name="<name of the joint>">
	<parent link="link1"/>
	<child link="link2"/>
	<calibration ...[[/>]]
	<dynamics damping .../>
	<limit effort .../>
	</joint>


=== robot ===
add all links and joints in this script. This tag encapsulates the entire robot model that can be represented
using URDF. Inside the robot tag, we can define the name of the robot, the links, and the joints of the robot.

	<robot name="<name of the robot>">
	<link> ... </link>
	<link> ... </link>
	<joint> ... </joint>
	<joint> ... </joint>
	</robot>
	

=== gazebo ===
This tag is used when we include the simulation parameters of the Gazebo simulator inside URDF. We can use this tag to include gazebo plugins, gazebo material properties, and so on. 
	<gazebo reference="link_1">
	<material>Gazebo/Black</material>
	</gazebo>
